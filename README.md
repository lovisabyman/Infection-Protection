# Infection Protection
Infection Protection is a survivor game where you will have to destroy the viruses before you get the infection. Viruses of different sizes drops from the ceiling and bounces against the floor until they are destroyed by the player. The player should therefore avoid getting hit by the viruses and in the mean time shoot down the viruses using sanitizer. But watch out! Some of the viruses will split when they are hit. Will you survive the pandemic?

This project was done as a part of the course TDDC76: Programming and Data Structures at Linköpings University by Lovisa Byman, Gunnar Arctaedius, Alice Nicklasson Cedbro, Johanna Carlson, Maja Boström and Maria Axelsson.
